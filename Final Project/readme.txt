How to Operate the Housing Price Prediction Model:

1. Open Summary_Housing_QF301.py
2. Ensure the code imports the 301data.csv file from your working directory
3. Run code to create classification variable and train/test split of data
4. Run cross validation test to ensure optimal parameters for model
5. Fit the Random Forest Classifier to the training set with the optimal parameters found in part 4
6. Run the prediction on the training set and receive price direction predictions
